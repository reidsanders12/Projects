# Projects

Welcome! 👋  

This is the repository where I keep a collection of projects, experiments, and ideas I've worked on **for fun**. These are from when I was **18 and older** — anything before this isn't here because, I didn’t know how to use Git back then. 

Expect a mix of random coding experiments, side projects, and things I built while learning, exploring, and trying out new ideas. Nothing here is guaranteed to be polished or finished — it’s more like my personal sandbox.

### 🛠️ What to Expect
- Projects I’ve worked on just for fun  
- Experiments with new tools, frameworks, and languages  
- Code I’m learning from, breaking, and improving

### 📌 Note
Anything **not** in this repo is from when I was younger, before I started using version control properly.

Feel free to explore, but don’t expect perfection. This repo is more about the journey than the destination. 🚀
